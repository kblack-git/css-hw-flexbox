In this exercise, you have been tasked with completing the layout for the "West Greenwich Estates" wedding venue website. You can refer to the screenshots above for reference. Copy the starter code and create a new repository on GitHub for this exercise.

Complete the following exercises/tasks and commit your code after you complete each one.

### Header Logo & Nav

Update the header of the website so that the layout looks like the screenshot. Specifically, make the logo and the links be on opposite sides of the header, with everything aligned to the vertical center of the header.

### Pricing Cards

Update the pricing section so that the cards are aligned to a row. Remove the dots and extra spacing from the list. Align all of the card content so that it is centered with the card.

### Card Width and Wrapping

In the pricing section, make sure that when the screen is too narrow the cards move onto multiple rows.

### Vendor List

Update the Partner Vendors list so that all of the logos go across the page rather than up-and-down. Each of the logos should vertically aligned to each other. When there is not enough space horizontally the logos should move onto multiple rows.

### Align Card Buttons

Update the cards so that when they are next to each other in the same row the buttons all align but the text stays at the top.
